      <p>This is a book app</p>
      <p>
        i chose to create this app about books because i love reading books, and
        i wanted to create an app that would help me find books to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        This app uses the Google Books API to fetch books and display them to
        the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user can search for books by title, author, or any keyword and view
        the results.
